## AFD∞-AMI Ethical Assistant
An AI assistant with human-like ethical reasoning using the Autonomous Fletcher Dynamics (AFD) formula, created by Sebastian Fletcher. This app processes user prompts in real-time, translates them using a lightweight LLM, and evaluates responses with the non-reward-based AFD formula for ethical coherence.

## Features

Real-Time Interaction: Enter prompts and receive ethically evaluated responses.
Reflection Panel: Displays coherence scores, trend graphs, and adjustment logs.
Human-Like Memory: Stores interactions in data/response_log.csv for learning.
